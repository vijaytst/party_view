## Collaboration model

This application uses Git flow collaboration model ...details can be found below

Git Flow - Why and How to use:
GitFlow is a collection of Git commands to define a strict branching model designed around the project release for Vincent Driessen's branching model.

Gitflow is really just an abstract idea of a Git workflow. This means it dictates what kind of branches to set up and how to merge them together. The git-flow toolset is an actual command line tool that has an installation process.Git-flow extension is a wrapper around Git.

Why should use git flow:
GitFlow is a collection of Git commands to provide many repository operations with just single command.
It was developed to manage the branching mechanism with a standardised approach when developing features,
handling releases and managing hotfixes.
Using multiple separate branches in Git will provide flexibility but gets complex. This is easy in gitflow.
It makes developer speed up the process with familiar branch structure.
Switching branches is easy.
Keep repository & process clean and tidy.
Installation:
Setup
You need a working git installation as prerequisite. Git flow works on macOS, Linux and Windows

macOS
Homebrew

$ brew install git-flow-avh

Macports

$ port install git-flow-avh

Linux (Debian)
$ apt-get install git-flow

Linux (Fedora)
$ sudo yum install gitflow

Windows (Cygwin)
$ wget -q -O - --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh/develop/contrib/gitflow-installer.sh install stable | bash

Getting started
Git flow needs to be initialized in order to customize your project setup.

Getting started
Git flow needs to be initialized in order to customize your project setup.


Initialize
After installing git-flow you can use it in your project by executing git flow init.

$ git flow init

The git flow init command is an extension of the default git init command and doesn't change anything in your repository other than creating branches for you.
You'll have to answer a few questions regarding the naming conventions for your branches.
It's recommended to use the default values.

How it works
Instead of a single master branch, this workflow uses two branches to record the history of the project. The master branch stores the official release history, and the develop branch serves as an integration
branch for features. It's also convenient to tag all commits in the master branch with a version number.

Feature Branches
Each new feature should reside in its own branch, which can be pushed to the central repository for backup/collaboration. But, instead of branching off of master, feature branches use develop as their parent branch. When a feature is complete, it gets merged back into develop. Features should never interact directly with master.

Creating a feature branch
Without the git-flow extensions:

  git checkout develop  
  git checkout -b feature_branch
When using the git-flow extension:

git flow feature start feature_branch
Publishing a feature branch
Without the git-flow extensions:

  git push origin feature_branch  
When using the git-flow extension:

git flow feature publish feature_branch
Get a feature published by another user.

git flow feature pull origin feature_branch 
You can track a feature on origin by using

git flow feature track feature_branch
Finishing a feature branch
When you’re done with the development work on the feature, the next step is to merge the feature_branch into develop.

Without the git-flow extensions:

git checkout develop  
git merge feature_branch  
Using the git-flow extensions:

git flow feature finish feature_branch  
Bugfix Branches
After finishing feature branch, if you get bug then you can create bugfix branch. Like as feature branch it will be always created from develop branch.

Creating a bugfix branch
git flow bugfix start bugfix_branch 
Publishing a feature branch
git flow bugfix publish bugfix_branch 
Finishing a bugfix branch
When you’re fixed bug, the next step is to merge the bugfix_branch into develop.

git flow bugfix finish bugfix_branch  
Release Branches
Creating this branch starts the next release cycle, so no new features can be added after this point—only bug fixes, documentation generation, and other release-oriented tasks should go in this branch. Once it's ready to ship, the release branch gets merged into master and tagged with a version number.

Creating a release branch
Without the git-flow extensions:

git checkout develop  
git checkout -b release/0.1.0  
When using the git-flow extensions:

git flow release start 0.1.0

Switched to a new branch 'release/0.1.0

Finishing a release branch
To finish a release branch, use the following methods:

Without the git-flow extensions:

git checkout master  
git merge release/0.1.0  
When using the git-flow extension::

git flow release finish '0.1.0'  
Once the release is ready to ship, it will get merged it into master and develop, then the release branch will be deleted. It’s important to merge back into develop because critical updates may have been added to the release branch and they need to be accessible to new features. If your organization stresses code review, this would be an ideal place for a pull request.

Don't forget to push your tags with git push origin --tags

Hotfix Branches
Maintenance or “hotfix” branches are used to quickly patch production releases. Hotfix branches are a lot like release branches and feature branches except they're based on master instead of develop. This is the only branch that should fork directly off of master. As soon as the fix is complete, it should be merged into both master and
develop (or the current release branch), and master should be tagged with an updated version number.

Creating a hotfix branch
Without the git-flow extensions:

git checkout master  
git checkout -b hotfix_branch  
When using the git-flow extensions:

 git flow hotfix start hotfix_branch  
Finishing a hotfix branch
Without the git-flow extensions:

git checkout master  
git merge hotfix_branch  
git checkout develop  
git merge hotfix_branch  
git branch -D hotfix_branch  
When using the git-flow extensions:

git flow hotfix finish hotfix_branch  
The overall flow of Gitflow is:
A develop branch is created from master
Feature branches are created from develop
When a feature is complete it is merged into the develop branch
Bugfix branches are created from develop
When bug fixed are done it is merged into the develop branch
Release branch is created from develop
When the release branch is done it is merged into develop and master
If an issue in master is detected a hotfix branch is created from master
When the hotfix is complete it is merged to both develop and master
