    question:'Twitch and DMCA, is this legal ?',
    Answer:"Yes. Content is not shared besides your facial reactions and twitch chat. These are synchronized with your viewers on a separate tab in your browsers through the ViewingParty extension. Each viewer would need to login to their own partner service(i.e Netflix) in order to participate in the event. Just make sure you are either using headphones or another method so that sound from the movie/show doesn't leak into your stream audio"
